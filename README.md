I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Climate Science Centre at CSIRO. My research is primarily focussed on climate extremes, such as droughts, floods and wildfire weather. I have expertise in characterising the past behaviour of extreme events, and analysing their potential drivers, particularly related to atmospheric dynamics. I also have a strong interest in climate forecasts on subseasonal-to-decadal time scales, including forecast applications for sectors such as water resources.
